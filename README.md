# Farmland size and climate adaptation practice adoption in the U.S.
Using AgCensus 2012, 2017 and 2022 –aggregated into 12 farmland size groupings at the state level–, and climate indicators from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), we examine differences across farm sizes (small, medium and large) on climate adaptation practices (cover crops, tile drainage and irrigation). We investigate the association between temporal changes in practice adoption and multiple government programs and climate changes. Models are run in the Bambi library from Python.
In this repository I share the code used to compile the different data sources, clean the data, and estimate the practice adoption models.
The Data folder contains the txt file with the complete database employed in this project, specifically, state-farm size level data from the AgCensuses 2012, 2017 and 2022, and state climate variables.
