# Farmland_size_climate_adaptation
Using AgCensus 2012, 2017 –disaggregated by 12 farm-size groups–, climate and weather indicators (Kling's repository), erosion (USDA-NRCS) and land use data (USDA-NASS), we investigate differences across farm sizes (small, medium and large) on climate change adaptation practices (cover crops, tile drainage and irrigation). We investigate whether climate change adaptation can be better understood and predicted from multilevel as compared to pooled models that use farm size as a control variable. We apply beta regression models within a Bayesian framework. Models are run using Bambi library from Python.
