# Farmland size and climate change adaptation practice adoption in the U.S.
Using AgCensus 2012, 2017 –disaggregated by 12 farm-size groups–, climate and weather indicators ([Kling's repository](https://github.com/matthewkling/ca2cc-county)), erosion (USDA-NRCS) and land use data (USDA-NASS), we examine differences across farm sizes (small, medium and large) on climate change adaptation practices (cover crops, tile drainage and irrigation). We also investigate whether climate change adaptation can be better understood and predicted from multilevel as compared to pooled models that use farm size as a control variable. We apply beta regression models within a Bayesian framework. Models are run in Bambi library from Python.
