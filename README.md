# Farmland size and climate adaptation practice adoption in the U.S.
Using AgCensus 2012, 2017 and 2022 –aggregated into 12 farmland size groupings–, and climate indicators from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), we examine differences across farm sizes (small, medium and large) on climate adaptation practices (cover crops, tile drainage and irrigation). We also investigate whether the drivers of farmers' climate adaptation behavior differ across farm size categories. Models are run in the Bambi library from Python.
